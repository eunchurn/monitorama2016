## Abstract

> Monitoring systems have not changed significantly in 20 years and has fallen
> behind the way be build software. Our software is now large distributed
> systems made up of many non-uniform interacting components while the core
> functionality of monitoring systems has stagnated.  Furthermore, it is often
> people without expert knowledge of systems under observation that are
> responsible for monitoring and operating them. In this talk, we will explore
> how our current monitoring capabilities are failing us and discuss how we can
> build systems that are both reliable and observable while making our lives
> (or the lives of the people responsible for their operations in production)
> easier.
